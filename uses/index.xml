By using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, a large volume payment processor may aggregate all their payments into a single O(1) transaction for purposes of confirmation. Then, some time later, the payments can be expanded out of that UTXO when the demand for blockspace is decreased.
Without OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, this is still possible to do with Schnorr signatures (even with ECDSA given multiparty schemes).</description></item><item><title>Decentralized options</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/options/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/options/</guid><description>Trading of bitcoin derivatives is a huge market nowadays. However, all of it occurs on centralized exchanges with large legal &amp;amp; technical risks that require trust in their operators, thus betraying the philosophy of Bitcoin. The protocol presented here enables the creation and redemption of trustless options on the Bitcoin network.
Main protocol Option creation will follow this protocol:
Use an atomic swap to sync these two operations: User pays fee to underwriter Underwriter sends tokenized USD [1] to an address that is encumbered by the script: After X+K blocks: Send to underwriter After X blocks: If spending tx sends Y BTC to underwriter, send to user When the option reaches maturity the user can exercise it by sending a transaction that: Sends BTC to underwriter Spends the UTXO created on step 1 and sends it to the user&amp;rsquo;s wallet If the user doesn&amp;rsquo;t exercise it on time the underwriter can just spend it to itself Reduction of capital requirement As it is, this protocol requires locking 100% of the collateral for as long as the option stays in effect, but it would also be possible to reduce the capital requirement quite substantially by changing the protocol to make the underwriter lock only 30-50% initially and, at option expiration, make it provide the rest of the payment in case the user decides to exercise the option.</description></item><item><title>Drivechains</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/drivechains/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/drivechains/</guid><description>Drivechain&amp;rsquo;s peg-out mechanism could be implemented at the transaction level through scripts that force the funds being withdrawn from the sidechain to go through a chain of N transactions, each one of these being in a different block. More specifically, this would be implemented by creating N scripts that would contain an integer constant and would only be spendable to another copy of the same script with the constant increased or decreased by one, with the exception of the script where the constant reaches the value N, in which case the UTXO would be spendable only to a specific address provided in the beginning of the process.</description></item><item><title>Batch Channels</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/batch-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:46:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/batch-channels/</guid><description>Using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY for Channel Factories is similar to the use for Congestion Control, except the leaf nodes should be set up as a channels instead of plain payments. The channel can be between the sender and recipient or a target of recipient&amp;rsquo;s choice. Using an OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the recipient may even give the sender an address which makes a set of channels unbeknownst to them.
These channels are already time insensitive for setup, as all punishments can be relative timelocked to the actual instantiation.</description></item><item><title>Non Interactive Channels</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/non-interactive-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:46:13 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/non-interactive-channels/</guid><description>Normally, when opening a payment channel, you require participation from both parties to the channel. This is because the Lightning Network uses pre-signed multi-sig type transactions to ensure that a channel can always be exited by either party, before entering.
With OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for a single party to construct a channel which either party can exit from without requiring signatures from both parties.
These payment channels can operate in one direction, paying to the channel &amp;ldquo;listener&amp;rdquo; without need for their private key to be online.</description></item><item><title>Trustless Coordination-Free Mining Pools</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:45:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/</guid><description>In a typical mining pool, miners works together to create a shared block reward. The shared reward is distributed among participants based on difficulty shares, that is, partial work proofs that &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; a miner was working on an appropriate block.
An appropriate block pays the reward to the pool operator, who then distributes (less a fee) the rewards to the other miners.
Using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, miners can instead look at a set of qualified historical blocks deterministically (e.</description></item><item><title>Vaults</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/vaults/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:45:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/vaults/</guid><description>When greater security is required for cold storage solutions, there can be default Tapscript paths that move funds from one target to another target.
For example, a cold wallet can be set up where one customer support desk can, without further authorization, move a portion of the funds (using multiple pre-set amounts) into a lukewarm wallet operated by an isolated support desk. The support desk can then issue some funds to a hot wallet, and send the remainder back to cold storage with a similar withdrawal mechanism in place.</description></item><item><title>Increasing Max Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS)</title><link>https://utxos.org/uses/htlcs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:30:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://utxos.org/uses/htlcs/</guid><description>In the Lightning Network protocol, Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS) are used in the construction of channels. A new HTLC is required per route that the channel is serving in.
In BOLT #2, this maximum number of HTLCs in a channel is hard limited to 483 as the maximum safe size to prevent the transaction from being too large to be valid. In common software implementations such as LND, this limit is set much lower to 12 HTLCS.</description></item></channel></rss>
